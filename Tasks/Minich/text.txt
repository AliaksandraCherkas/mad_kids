The February
TIOBE Index 
of the most 
popular prog
ramming lang
uages is out
, and while 
the work goi
ng on in the
background o
f TIOBE‚Äôs 
calculations
has changed,
not much has
shifted in t
he way of ra
nkings. Pyth
on continues
to sit atop 
the index, w
ith C and Ja
va directly 
behind it. I
n Feb. 2021,
those three 
also occupie
d the top sp
ot, but with
Python in th
e number thr
ee position,
C at top, an
d Java in se
cond place. 
Beyond the t
op three, th
ere hasn‚Äôt
been much mo
vement in th
e index, wit
h positions 
four through
eight unchan
ged from the
same time la
st year. Tho
se slots are
occupied, re
spectively, 
by C++, C#, 
Visual Basic
, JavaScript
and PHP. Pos
itions nine 
and 10 swapp
ed from Feb.
21 to now, w
ith Assembly
Language and
SQL now occu
pying each o
ther‚Äôs pos
itions. The 
one big move
of note betw
een Feb. 202
1 and Feb. 2
022 was with
the Groovy p
rogramming l
anguage, an 
object-orien
ted language
for Java. Ov
er the cours
e of the yea
r, Groovy fe
ll from 12th
position all
the way to 2
0th, putting
it perilousl
y close to t
he ‚Äúother 
programming 
languages‚Äù
list. TIOBE 
CEO Paul Jan
sen attribut
es Groovy‚Äô
s decline to
the growth i
n the CI/CD 
space. Groov
y was the on
ly language 
used for wri
ting scripts
on Jenkins, 
which Jansen
describes as
having been 
‚Äúthe only 
real player 
in the CI/CD
domain‚Äù ea
rly on. Now,
with platfor
ms that don‚
Äôt require 
Groovy, like
GitHub, Azur
e DevOps and
GitLab, Groo
vy is losing
its place at
the table. ‚
ÄúGroovy cou
ld have grow
n further be
cause it was
the major sc
ript-based a
lternative f
or Java runn
ing on the s
ame JVM. How
ever, Kotlin
is taking ov
er that posi
tion right n
ow, so I thi
nk Groovy wi
ll have a ha
rd time,‚Äù 
Jensen said.
The TIOBE in
dex may not 
be full of s
urprises thi
s month, but
Jansen did h
ave a lot to
say about th
e index itse
lf this mont
h, as this i
s the first 
time it has 
been compile
d using Simi
larweb‚Äôs t
raffic analy
sis platform
instead of A
lexa. ‚ÄúWe 
have used Si
milarweb for
the first ti
me this mont
h to select 
search engin
es and fortu
nately, ther
e are no big
changes in t
he index due
to this swap
. The only s
triking diff
erence is th
at the top 3
languages, P
ython, C, an
d Java, all 
gained more 
than 1 perce
nt in the ra
nkings,‚Äù J
ansen said. 
TIOBE decide
d to make th
e switch thi
s month afte
r Amazon‚Äôs
announcement
in December 
2021 that it
was shutting
the Alexa we
b ranking se
rvice down, 
effective Ma
y 1, 2022, e
nding 25 yea
rs of the pr
ogram. Janse
n noted that
not every we
bsite has be
en onboarded
, but that t
he switch to
Similarweb i
ncluded a sw
itch to usin
g HtmlUnit, 
a non-GUI we
b browser wi
th APIs that
let Java app
s invoke pag
es, fill for
ms and do ot
her standard
web browsing
activity. Th
is switch wi
ll eventuall
y allow TIOB
E to include
websites it 
was unable t
o crawl befo
re, like Sta
ckoverflfow 
and Github, 
which could 
have a large
r impact on 
scores
